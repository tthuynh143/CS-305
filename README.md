As a software developer at Global Rain, a company that specializes in custom software design and development for entrepreneurs, businesses, and government agencies around the world, I was tasked with assisting Artemis Financial in modernizing its operations and applying the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API) and is seeking Global Rain's expertise in taking steps to protect the organization from external threats.
I began by working under the premise that security is everyone's responsibility. This is especially important for financial institutions, which need to protect customer data, company information, and intellectual property. Since Artemis Financials' web-based software is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans, it is important to secure every communication that involves customer account information during the assessment process.
To secure Artemis Financials' system, I looked at the key components of the code, including:
•	Code quality: Ensuring the code is written in a readable and maintainable manner.
•	Secure coding: Implementing good code sanitization practices, such as exception handling and error checks, and maintaining consistency in the business logic of the application.
•	Cryptography: Encrypting sensitive data to protect its integrity and confidentiality when transmitted over the internet.
•	Client/server: Securing communication between the customer (client) and the backend of the web application (server) for financial transactions.
•	API: Securing the API configuration to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.
One of the best ways to ensure secure and effective dependencies is to incorporate a dependency-check plugin scanner into the code. This is a non-intrusive test that can be used to ensure that all dependencies are current and up to date, as outdated dependencies can make the application less secure.
The world of online security is constantly changing, but there are several key steps that can be taken to protect software systems from external threats. By focusing on code quality, secure coding, cryptography, client/server security, and API security, businesses can reduce the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.
